# Bias Plots

Graphs of the effects of biases on measures of risk from these two papers:

- Bias due to misclassification in the estimation of relative risk,
  by [Copeland et al, 1977](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a112408),
  and
- The effects of exposure misclassification on estimates of relative risk,
  by [Flegal et al, 1986](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a114294).
  
Graphs were re-drawn with R ggplot2.
